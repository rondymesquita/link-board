##Theme sctructure
- Put themes in **app/themes** folder following the structure
    - [THEME-NAME]
        - --- **comments** (directive view for comments)
            - --- **comments.html** (default view for comments)
        - --- **footer** (directive view for footer)
            - --- **footer.html** (default view for footer)

        - --- **sidebar** (directive for sidebars)
            - --- **sidebar.html** (view for sidebars)

##Structure
The structure is simple:

 - **app**
	- **components**
		- **app.module.js**  (the core of phoenix js) (Module configuration)
		- **app.routes.js** (All routes used in phoenix)
		- **controllers** (folder containing controllers)
		- **directives** (folder containing directives)
		- **filters** (folder containing filters)
		- **functions** (folder containing common functions)
		- **services** (folder containing services)
	- **themes** (where the themes are installed)
	- **index.html** (the root file)
	- **config.js** (The configurations of your site. You can customize some attributes. Used inside the controllers, directives, filters, routes, functions and services)
	- **constants.js** (The constants to be used inside theme html files)


You don't need to worry about controllers, directives, filters, functions and services. They are ready to work for you. You just need create your content folder, put the content inside, choose (or create) your theme and you site is ready.
Of course, feel free to change any file and customize your experience.
The **index.html** is the root file where all dependencies are linked. So, you can add any css or js file to your site.

##Content
The content is based on a json file that works like a index for posts meta and markdown and html file for post content. So, you don't need any database.

You create a folder **content** sibling **app** folder like.

 - **app**
 - **content**
     - **menus** (menus)
     - **pages** (pages)
         - **example.md** (a markdown page)
         - **pages.json** (pages index)
         - **static_pages** (the static pages)
	         - **custom_index.html** (the custom index page)
     - **posts** (posts)
         - **1.md** (a markdown post)
         - **2.html** (a html post)
         - **posts.json** (posts index)
         - **images** (the images folder of posts)
